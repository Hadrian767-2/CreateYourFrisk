since you're here anyway: there's a small easter egg on the text commands page but it's probably not worth finding, sorry
you may notice this page's code is garbage: i'm not a web designer! ;-;
it's w3c valid, at least

            <p>
                <br><span class="function">Screen.DispImg(<span class="string"></span> path, <span class="number"></span> id,
                <span class="number"></span> posX, <span class="number"></span> posY, <span class="number"></span> toneR = 255,
                <span class="number"></span> toneG = 255, <span class="number"></span> toneB = 255,
                <span class="string"></span> toneA = 255)</span>
                This function displays an image on a given point on the map. This image will take the form of an event, and this event will be
                named <span class="term">"Image" + id</span>.<br>
                Also, you'll have to give the position of your image using <span class="term">posX</span> and <span class="term">posY</span>.<br>
                You can add a color to the image with the 4 last values, if you want to. If you do, these values must be between 0 and 255.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br><span class="function">Screen.SupprImg(<span class="string"></span> id)</span>
                Deletes an image previously created with a <span class="term">Screen.DispImg()</span> function.<br>
                In application, it's basically the same as <span class="term">Event.Remove("Image" .. id)</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br><span class="function">Screen.SetTone(<span class="boolean"></span> anim, <span class="boolean"></span> waitEnd,
                <span class="number"></span> r = 255, <span class="number"></span> g = 255, <span class="number"></span> b = 255,
                <span class="number"></span> a = 128)</span>
                Creates a solid color image over the whole screen with a given color (for instance, you can use this for a sepia tone).<br>
                Set <span class="term">anim</span> to true to gradually transition to the tone.<br>
                If <span class="term">anim</span> is set to true, you can also set <span class="term">waitEnd</span> to true to make the event's code
                pause until the transition is done. For the other values, they must be between 0 and 255.
                <br><br>
                128 is the recommended value for <span class="term">a</span>.<br>
                The <span class="term">a</span> value can go up to 255, which means fully opaque, but at that point the screen will be fully obscured.
                <br><br><br>
                <font color="ffffff">* NOTE: To undo the efffects of this function, call <span class="term">SetTone</span> again
                but with the argument <span class="term">a</span> as <span class="term">0</span>.<br>
                You can remove it instantly as well if you set <span class="term">anim</span> to false!</font></span>

                <span class="boolean"></span> waitEnd = true)</span>
                Flashes the screen for a given number of frames. A flash is an image that is displayed on top of the entire screen and fades afterwards.<br>
                Change the color of the flash by changing the values of the 4 other variables. Each one must be between 0 and 255.<br><br>
                By default, the script will halt execution until the flash has stopped. Set <span class="term">waitEnd</span> to false to bypass this and
                continue the script instead.
