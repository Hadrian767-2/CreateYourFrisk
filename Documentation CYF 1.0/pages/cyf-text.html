            <h2><span class="CYF"></span> The Text Object</h2><br><br>
            <p>A lot of people were waiting for this: I'm proud to present to you the Text Object! With it, you can create text
                wherever you want, with or without a bubble, with a tail or without a tail... It's 100%
                your choice!</p>
            <p>Plus, if you choose to make a bubble, the height of the bubble is automatically computed, but you can still choose the
                bubble's height if you want to.</p>
            <p>By default, a Text Object has a bubble with an automatically-set height, with no tail/speech thing. Plus, the object is hidden when
                you enter or come out of <span class="term">ENEMYDIALOGUE</span>. If you want to change this, there are a lot of functions
                to do so. Look down to see them!
                <br>
                <span class="new"></span> As this object exists in CYF's hierarchy, it's possible to manipulate its parent.
                See the <span class="ref">General Objects</span> page for more information.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function">CreateText(<span class="luatable"><span class="string"></span></span> / <span class="string"></span> text,
                <span class="luatable"><span class="number"></span>, <span class="number"></span></span> position, <span class="number"></span> width, <span class="string"></span> layer = "BelowPlayer", <span class="number"></span>  bubbleHeight = -1) returns <span class="userdata">textObject</span> [E/M/W]</span>
                This function creates a Text Object and returns it. However, as you can see, a lot of parameters are needed.
                <Br>Here is what you need to set:
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="term">text</span> - The text to display.
                    <br>Used the same way as in <span class="term">BattleDialog</span>: <span class="term">{"Text 1", "Text 2"}</span>
                    <br>Can also just be a single line of text.</li><br>
                    <li><span class="term">position</span> - <b>Two numbers</b>: The x and y positions of the center of the object. Sorry if it may be hard to place it, but you'll be
                    able to use <span class="term">MoveTo</span> to adjust it afterwards.
                    <br>You only need two numbers, like this:
                    <span class="term">{320, 240}</span></li><br>
                    <li><span class="term">width</span> - You'll always need this, as it's the maximum width of the text! The bubble's width will be 20px larger than the text's
                    width. Also, bubbles have a minimum width of 40.<br>Example: <span class="term">150</span></li><br>
                    <li><span class="term">layer</span> - The sprite layer of the Text Object. If it doesn't exist, it returns an error. This argument is
                    optional. If it's not provided, the Text Object will be in the layer <span class="term">BelowPlayer</span> (or <span class="term">Default</span> in the Overworld).
                    <br>Example: <span class="term">"BelowPlayer"</span></li><br>
                    <li><span class="term">bubbleHeight</span> - You can enter a static bubble height here if you want to. By default, this will
                    be -1, which will auto compute the height of the bubble. However, bubbles have a minimum height of 40.
                    <br>Example: <span class="term">150</span></li><br>
                </ul>
                NOTE: To allow for using properties such as <span class="term">Text.SetFont</span> and <span class="term">Text.color</span> on the same frame as creating the text object, a one-frame delay is implemented by default: The text object will not create its letters or start typing until one frame after you call <span class="term">CreateText</span>. As a consequence, expect a few properties such as <span class="term">Text.color</span> and <span class="term">Text.GetLetters</span> to run into issues if you run them on the same frame you use <span class="term">CreateText</span>.
                <br><br>
                If you need to disable the one-frame delay, start your first line of text with the <span class="ref">Text Command</span> <span class="term">[instant]</span>. And if you need to disable <i>that</i> too, follow it up with <span class="term">[instant:stop]</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function">Text.Remove()</span>
                Shortcut to <span class="term">Text.DestroyText</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function">Text.DestroyText()</span>
                This function destroys a text object, similar to <span class="term">.Remove()</span> for bullets and sprites.
                <br><br>
                Trying to get, set or call almost anything besides <span class="term">Text.isactive</span> on a destroyed text object will error.
                <br><br>
                Note that this happens automatically if a text object closes itself, either by having the player close it or by closing automatically if <span class="term">progressmode</span> is <span class="term">"auto"</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="new function"><span class="luatable"><span class="string"></span></span>Text.text</span>
                Returns all lines of text the text object is holding. The texts might be different to how you added them to the text object because of how CYF handles text.
                <br><br>
                For example, if your text is too long to be held within one line, the text object will replace spaces with newline characters when needed. This change will
                be visible on the current line of text and all previous ones, but not on the lines of text which have yet to be displayed.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="boolean"></span> Text.isactive</span>
                <b>Read-only.</b><br>
                Tells you if a text object is active.
                <br><br>
                A text object will become inactive when it finishes its text and tries to continue,
                or if you call <span class="term">Text.DestroyText()</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="string"></span> Text.progressmode</span>
                This value is used to set the progression mode of the text to one of the following values.
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="term">"auto"</span>: Makes the text start a new line after a given number of frames
                    set in <span class="term">Text.SetAutoWaitTimeBetweenTexts()</span>.</li>
                    <li><span class="term">"manual"</span>: Makes the text require the player to press the Confirm button at
                    the end of each line.</li>
                    <li><span class="term">"none"</span>: With this option, you will need to manually display the next line
                    in-code using <span class="term">Text.NextLine()</span>.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="boolean"></span> Text.deleteWhenFinished</span>
                This value is used to check whether the text object should be removed or not after the text is finished.
                Its default value is <span class="term">true</span>, meaning the text object will be automatically removed after the end of the text.
                You can set it to <span class="term">false</span> to automatically hide the text object once its text is complete, which allows you to reuse it later.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="number"></span> Text.x</span>
                The local x position of the object, measured from the position of the text object's parent. This value depends on the object's pivot.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="number"></span> Text.y</span>
                The local y position of the object, measured from the position of the text object's parent. This value depends on the object's pivot.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="number"></span> Text.absx</span>
                The absolute x position of the object, measured from the bottom left corner of the screen. This value depends on the object's pivot.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="number"></span> Text.absy</span>
                The absolute y position of the object, measured from the bottom left corner of the screen. This value depends on the object's pivot.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="new function"><span class="number"></span> Text.textMaxWidth or Text.width</span>
                Get or set the maximum width of the text. If the value is lower than 16, it'll be set back to 16.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="number"></span> Text.bubbleHeight</span>
                Get or set the height of the bubble. If the value is lower than 40, it'll be set back to 40.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="string"></span> Text.layer</span>
                The sprite layer of the Text Object. If it doesn't exist, it returns an error. This is <span class="term">"BelowPlayer"</span> by default.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="luatable"><span class="number"></span>, <span class="number"></span>,
                <span class="number"></span>, <span class="number"></span> = 1 </span> Text.color</span>
                Get or set the color of the text, as a table of 3 or 4 values from 0 to 1.<br>For example, <span class="term">
                text.color = {1.0, 0.0, 0.0}</span> makes the text red.<br>Black areas are not affected by coloration.<br>
                The 4th value is the alpha (transparency) value of the text.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="luatable"><span class="number"></span>, <span class="number"></span>,
                <span class="number"></span>, <span class="number"></span> = 255 </span> Text.color32</span>
                Get or set the color of the text, as a table of 3 or 4 integer values from 0 to 255.<br>For example, <span class="term">
                text.color = {250, 0, 0}</span> makes it red.<br>Black areas are not affected by coloration.<br>
                The 4th value is the alpha (transparency) value of the text.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function">Text.ResetColor(<span class="boolean"></span> resetAlpha = false)</span>
                Resets any previous set of the variable <span class="term">Text.color</span> or <span class="term">Text.color32</span>,
                resetting the text's default color to the font's default color.<br>
                This function will not reset the color's <span class="term">alpha</span> if it was set in any way unless
                <span class="term">resetAlpha</span> is set to true.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="number"></span> Text.alpha</span>
                Get or set the text's transparency, as a value between 0 and 1.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="number"></span> Text.alpha32</span>
                Get or set the text's transparency, as an integer between 0 and 255.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function">Text.ResetAlpha()</span>
                Resets the text object's <span class="term">alpha</span> value, whether it was set through <span class="term">Text.alpha</span>,
                <span class="term">Text.color</span> or <span class="term">Text.color32</span>, resetting the text's default alpha to the font's default alpha.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="new function"><span class="number"></span> Text.currentCharacter</span>
                Returns a number representing the total number of characters currently shown in the text object's text.
                <br>It also works the same if your text is slowed down or sped up.
                <br><br>Text commands are also taken in account using this variable.
                You can easily check where the text is currently at using this value and <span class="term">Text.text</span>'s output.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="number"></span> Text.currentReferenceCharacter</span>
                Returns a number representing the total number of visible characters currently shown in the text object's text.
                <br>It also works the same if your text is slowed down or sped up.
                <br><br>Any text commands that you have in your active line of text will be ignored by this number, as it only counts the visible characters, and not the length of the string you put into the text object.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="new function"><span class="number"></span> Text.rotation</span>
                Gets or sets a text object's rotation, in degrees. Will also rotate the text object's bubble if it has any.
                <br><br>The text object will rotate around the bottom left corner of the first letter of the text object.
                <br><br>It's clamped between 0 and 360, so if you set it to 365, it will become 5.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="new function"><span class="number"></span> Text.adjustTextDisplay</span>
                False by default. If set to true, CYF will try to adjust the text's position and scale to prevent jagged lines to appear if the text's scale or position is slightly off.
                <br><br>Only taken in account if set, otherwise the global value set through the <span class="term">adjusttextdisplay</span> Encounter variable is used.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="number"></span> Text.currentLine</span>
                Returns the number of the line (page) that the text is currently on, starting from 0.
                <br><br>So, if your text object's text table is <span class="term">{"Text 1", "Text 2"}</span>, then <span class="term">"Text 1"</span> is line 0, and <span class="term">"Text 2"</span> is line 1.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="new function"><span class="string"></span> Text.linePrefix</span>
                This variable will be added at the beginning of each line of text the text object will display.
                <br><br>Useful for adding various text commands you want to apply to all lines of text displayed by a given text object.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="new function"><span class="number"></span> Text.columnNumber</span>
                Represents the number of columns used by some texts in CYF, such as the ITEM and ACT menu.
                <br>If this is value is set, you should also consider changing <span class="term">Text.columnShift</span>.
                <br><br>This value is only ever used by the engine, so setting it to a specific value doesn't prevent you from using the character <span class="term">\t</span> as much as you like.
                <br>Refer to the entry on <span class="term">Text.columnShift</span> for more informations on the character <span class="term">\t</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="new function"><span class="number"></span> Text.columnShift</span>
                Amount of horizontal pixels the letters moves by from its last column (or first character) whenever the character <span class="term">\t</span> is used.
                <br><br>The <span class="term">\t</span> character is used in-engine for aligning columns of text. It affects the current line of the text and can be used several times on the same line to support more than two columns.
                <br><br>For example, the following text will result with the following image:
                <br><div class="code-container"><pre class="brush: lua">* Check \t * Act 1 \t * Act 2 \n
* Act 3 \t * Act 4 \t * Act 5 \n
\t \t * Act 6</pre></div>
                <img src="../img/columns.png" height="140">
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="luatable"><span class="userdata">sprite</span></span> Text.GetLetters()</span>
                Returns a table containing sprite objects representing every letter to be displayed in the text object's current line of text. Note that even if a text object has not finished typing yet, all characters it will type are still accessible this way.
                <h4>Letter sprite objects can not have their layer changed, can not run <span class="term">sprite.Mask</span>, and can only be parented to other letter sprites. They cannot be deleted or dusted (using sprite.Dust()) as well.</h4>
                <br>NOTE: Accessing this table generates the table anew every time. To save on resources, store this table to a local variable before doing any operations on it. Even code such as <span class="term">for i = 1, #text.GetLetters() do</span> is a bad idea.
                <br><br>
                It is recommended to use this property in coordination with the <span class="ref">Game Event</span> <span class="term">OnTextAdvance</span>. You may also not be able to use this on the same frame as creating the text - read the note under <span class="term">CreateText</span> for more information.
                <br><br><br>
                Here is an example of using <span class="term">Text.GetLetters</span> to apply offset and rotation to every letter.
                <br><div class="code-container"><pre class="brush: lua">local t = CreateText({"Some example text for testing!"}, {40, 400}, 560, "Top")
t.HideBubble()
t.progressmode = "none"

function OnTextAdvance(text, final)
    if text == t and final == false then -- optional if you only have one text object
        local letters = t.GetLetters()

        for i = 1, #letters do
            letters[i].y = math.sin(i) * 3

            </pre></div>
            Alternatively, if you want it all done on the first frame, it's much more compact:
            <br><div class="code-container"><pre class="brush: lua">local t = CreateText({"[instant]Some example text for testing!"}, {40, 400}, 560, "Top")
t.HideBubble()
t.progressmode = "none"

local letters = t.GetLetters()

for i = 1, #letters do
    letters[i].y = math.sin(i) * 3
    letters[i].rotation = math.sin(i * 1.5) * 6
end
            </pre></div>

                <br><span class="function"><span class="userdata">function</span> Text.OnTextDisplay(<span class="userdata">text</span> text)</span>
                Every time this text object's letters are created, this function gets called. This function is the best
                place to manipulate the text object's letters using <span class="term">Text.GetLetters</span>.
                <br><br>
                The argument <span class="term">text</span> is the text object itself.
                <br><br>
                If this value isn't set and the function <span class="term">OnTextDisplay()</span> exists in the Encounter
                script, it will call it with the text object as its argument.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function">Text.SkipLine()</span>
                This function skips to the end of the text object's current text, as if using the text command <span class="term">[instant]</span>.<br>
                If <span class="term">playerskipdocommand</span> is true, this function will behave the same as a player skip.
                See <span class="ref">Special Variables</span> for an explanation on <span class="term">playerskipdocommand</span>.

            <p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="number"></span> Text.lineCount()</span>
                This function returns the total number of lines/pages of text set to the text object, regardless of whether they've been shown yet.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function">Text.NextLine()</span>
                Shows the next line (dialogue) of the text instantly, regardless of if the current one is finished or what progress mode the object has.<br>
                If you run this function while this is this text object's last line, it will delete the text object if its
                <span class="term">Text.deleteWhenFinished</span> variable is set to true, othrwise it will deactive it until further use.

            <p>
                <br><span class="function">Text.SetAutoWaitTimeBetweenTexts(<span class="number"></span> time)</span>
                Sets the number of frames to wait before automatically going to the next line of text.<br><i>Only applies to the "auto" progress mode.</i>

                <br><span class="function">Text.SetAnchor(<span class="number"></span> x, <span class="number"></span> y)</span>
                If this text object has a parent set via <span class="term">Text.SetParent</span>, this will control its anchor point
                (the relative point on the parent sprite that the text object will follow if the parent sprite gets scaled).
                <br><br>
                <span class="term">x</span> and <span class="term">y</span> should usually both be between <span class="term">0</span> and <span class="term">1</span>.
                However, you are free to use numbers outside of this range as well.
                <br><br>
                Works exactly the same as <span class="term">sprite.SetAnchor</span> (see <span class="ref">Sprites &amp; Animation</span>).
            </p>
            <p>

                <span class="number"></span> Text.yscale<br></span>
                Allows you to stretch and squish text objects, similarly to sprite objects.
                <br><br>
                This works at any point: while the text has not yet started to type, is in the middle of typing, is paused, between lines, even if it's done typing.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function">Text.Scale(<span class="number"></span> xscale, <span class="number"></span> yscale)</span>

            <p>
                <br><span class="function">Text.MoveBelow(<span class="userdata">text</span> otherTextObject)</span>
                Moves a text object below another text object.<br>They must both be on the same layer.

            <p>
                <br><span class="function">Text.MoveAbove(<span class="userdata">text</span> otherTextObject)</span>

            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function">Text.SendToTop()</span>
                Sends this text object to the top of its layer's hierarchy. If a sprite has 5
                children, for instance, you can use this to rearrange this text object's position internally.
                However, child text objects will always appear on top of their parents, regardless of this
                function being called.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function">Text.SendToBottom()</span>
                Sends this text objct to the bottom of its layer's hierarchy. Similar rules apply as with <span class="term">SendToTop()</span>.

                Adds the given text to the object's text table. Acts like <span class="term">Text.SetText()</span> if all the text is already done.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function">Text.SetText(<span class="luatable"><span class="string"></span></span> text <font style="color:#fff;">(OR)</font> <span class="string"></span> text)</span>
                Sets the text in the Text Object.<br>If the text object is inactive when this is called, the object will reactive itself.

            <p>
                <br><span class="function">Text.SetPause(<span class="boolean"></span> pause)</span>
                Pauses the text object's typing, in the same way as <span class="term">[waitfor:key]</span>, except that it doesn't resume until you use this function again.
                <br><br>However, while paused, text can still be skipped, unless <span class="term">[noskip]</span> is applied to the text first.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="boolean"></span> Text.isPaused()</span>
                This function will return a boolean, telling you whether text has been paused with <span class="term">SetPaused</span>.
                <br>It does not count if the text object was paused by other means, such as <span class="term">[waitfor:key]</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function">Text.SetVoice(<span class="string"></span> voiceName)</span>
                Sets the voice of the text object. It's the same as the text command <span class="term">[voice]</span>, but whatever.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function">Text.SetFont(<span class="string"></span> fontName)</span>
                Sets the font of the text. It's the same as the text command <span class="term">[font]</span>, but whatever.<br>
                Returns an error if the font doesn't exist.<br>
            </p>

                <br><span class="function">Text.SetEffect(<span class="string"></span> effect, <span class="number"></span> intensity = -1)</span>
                Sets the effect of the text. Can be easily replaced with the text command <span class="term">[effect]</span>, but whatever.<br>
                Can only take <span class="term">none</span>, <span class="term">twitch</span>, <span class="term">shake</span> or
                <span class="term">rotate</span> as the effect.
                <br><br>
                If you want to use the default intensity value, enter <span class="term">-1</span>.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function">Text.ShowBubble(<span class="string"></span> side = nil, <span class="number"></span>/<span class="string"></span> position = nil)</span>
                Use this function to add a bubble to the text. You can also set the side and the position of the tail (a.k.a. speech thing) if you
                want to.<br>
                Look at <span class="term">Text.SetSpeechThingPositionAndSide</span> to see how to use this.

                Sets the size and position of the dialogue bubble's tail (a.k.a speech thing). The <span class="term">side</span> can only take
                <span class="term">"left"</span>, <span class="term">"right"</span>, <span class="term">"up"</span>, <span class="term">"down"</span> or
                <span class="term">"none"</span>.<br>
                <span class="term">"none"</span> is used to hide the speech thing, while the other directions control the side of the bubble where the
                speech thing is.<br><br>
                <span class="term">position</span> can be set to one of two things:
                <ul>
                    <li>A number. If the <span class="term">side</span> is <span class="term">"left"</span> or <span class="term">"right"</span>, this will
                    determine its distance from the bottom of the bubble. If the <span class="term">side</span> is <span class="term">"up"</span>
                    or <span class="term">"down"</span>, then this will determine its distance from the right side of the bubble.
                    <br>If on the bottom or top of the bubble, this value can only be between 0 and the bubble's width. If on the left or right sides
                    of the bubble, this value can only be between 0 and the bubble's height.</li><br>
                    <li>A string. It must be formatted like <span class="term">"0%"</span>, where you can replace the "0" with any percentage.
                    If on the top or bottom of the bubble, <span class="term">"0%"</span> will be the right side of the bubble and
                    <span class="term">"100%"</span> will be the left side of the bubble. If on the left or right side, <span class="term">"0%"</span>
                    will be the bottom of the bubble and <span class="term">"100%"</span> will be the top of the bubble. The value can only be between
                    "0%" and "100%".</li><br>
