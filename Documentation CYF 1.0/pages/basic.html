since you're here anyway: there's a small easter egg on the text commands page but it's probably not worth finding, sorry
you may notice this page's code is garbage: i'm not a web designer! ;-;
it's w3c valid, at least

            <h2>Basic setup</h2><br><br>
            <p>By this point you'll probably want to set up an encounter of your own. Currently, scripts are set up like this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><u>Monster scripts</u> - will contain information about your enemies. Here, you'll set things like their
                    ATK, DEF, HP, random comments that might show up as encounter texts, random dialogue, and what ACT
                    commands they have.
                </li><br>
                <li><u>Encounter scripts</u> - will contain a set of monsters, a set of wave scripts (that you can modify at
                    any point), size of the arena, custom interactions for items, etc. A mod can have multiple encounter scripts.
                </li><br>
                <li><u>Wave scripts</u> - will contain an update function. You may use these to spawn, track, modify and
                    otherwise interact with bullets during the defending phase of the game.
                </li><br>
                <li><span class="CYF"></span> <u>Event scripts</u> - used within the Overworld. Will contain different functions
                    that can be set up within Unity to run under certain conditions in game.
                </li><br>
                <li><span class="CYF"></span> <u>Shop scripts</u> - used within the Overworld. Will contain many variables and
                    functions controlling not only what items can be sold at what prices, but also shopkeeper dialog, special
                    code and events to run, and the potential to animate the shopkeeper yourself.
                </li><br>
            </ul>
            <p>From the mod selection screen, you may pick any mod, and play any encounter script within that mod.
                <br><span class="CYF"></span> In Create Your Frisk, the Overworld exists, and battles can be initiated from the
                Overworld with proper setup.</p>
            <p><span class="CYF"></span> As of CYF v0.6.4, the only folder required within a mod is the
                <span class="term">YOUR MOD/Lua/Encounters/</span> folder. For all older versions, your encounter will
                break if the other folders are missing.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Files and directories</h3><br><br>
            <p>It's fairly self-explanatory. If you just want to move on fast, feel free to skip this section and go to
                the next one. If for any reason some of your files don't work, you might want to read this anyway.</p>
            <h4>Scripts</h4>
            <p>The <i>Encounter scripts</i> are located in <span class="term">YOUR MOD/Lua/Encounters/</span>. The <i>Monster scripts</i>
                are in <span class="term">YOUR MOD/Lua/Monsters/</span>, and your wave scripts at <span class="term">YOUR MOD/Lua/Waves/</span>.
                If you're getting started, check out these files in example encounters to see how they're put together.
                <br><br>
                You may also create a <span class="term">YOUR MOD/Lua/Libraries/</span> folder. You can put libraries other
                people have made in here (or create your own) for use in your other scripts. Libraries/modules are more
                Lua functionality than they are Unitale functionality, so please read up about them
                <a href="http://lua-users.org/wiki/ModulesTutorial">here</a> instead. There is an example encounter
                included making use of one such library.
                <br><br>
                <span class="CYF"></span> In the Overworld, <i>Event scripts</i> are located in
                <span class="term">YOURMOD/Lua/Events/</span>, and <i>Shop scripts</i> are located in
                <span class="term">YOURMOD/Lua/Shops</span>. These features are explained in the <span class="ref">Overworld</span>
                category in this documentation.</p>
            <h4>Music</h4>
            <p>Music can be put in <span class="term">YOUR MOD/Audio/</span>. Your music must be in .ogg or .wav format. <a
                    href="http://audacityteam.org/download/">Audacity</a> can export to .ogg if you're missing the
                appropriate software.</p>
            <h4>Sounds</h4>
            <p>Sounds can be put in <span class="term">YOUR MOD/Sounds/</span>. They must be in .ogg or .wav format. You can play them with
                <span class="term">Audio.PlaySound(filename)</span>; more on this in <span class="ref">The Audio Object</span>.</p>
            <h4>Voices</h4>
            <p>Voices can be put in <span class="term">YOUR MOD/Voices/</span>. They must be in .ogg or .wav format, although .wav is
                generally recommended. You can use them with the <span class="term">[voice]</span> text command; more on this in
                <span class="ref">Text Commands</span>.</p>
            <h4>Sprites</h4>
            <p>Sprites can be put in <span class="term">YOUR MOD/Sprites/</span>. They must be in the .png format. Note that most vanilla
                Undertale monster sprites start with a small base resolution, then resize the sprite to 2x its original
                resolution for an oldschool look.
                <br><br>
                To <i>add a background</i> you can have one file titled <span class="term">bg.png</span>
                in the sprites folder. This image will stretch over the entire background, so 640x480 resolution is
                recommended. Actually modifying and animating the background from the Lua side is not possible;
                <span class="CYF"></span> however, in CYF, you may use sprite layers to create a sprite behind
                the built-in background layer and animate <i>that</i> instead.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>The Default directory</h3><br><br>
            <p>Unitale and Create Your Frisk both have a "Default" directory. This is where resources from Undertale reside.
                It is not advised to modify files in this directory, as they are expected to be the same across all
                installations. <br><br>If you wish to replace any of the files for your mod, create a file with the same
                name at the same location instead. For instance, if you want to change the player soul hurt sound, don't
                replace <span class="term">Default/Sounds/hurtsound.wav</span>. Instead, create a new file located at
                <span class="term">YOUR MOD/Sounds/hurtsound.wav</span>. This also goes for sprites, music, and even fonts.</p>
